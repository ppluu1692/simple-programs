Programs to solve simple mathematical problems.

I tried to think and solve a problem every day with a C++ program in September 2020, when I just finished high school. That time was amazing, the programs helped me learn and improve my programming skills a lot. Unfortunately, I couldn't maintain this process for long due to a lack of ideas and time. Anyway, it was a great effort for me when I didn't even have a computer for programming ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ.
